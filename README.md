# Mute-Button

I saw various people making and selling mute buttons this past year, including [Microsoft](https://www.onmsft.com/news/iot-enthusiasts-can-now-create-their-own-mute-button-for-microsoft-teams), and thought it would be a fun project. Like others, this project uses the Trinket as a HID/keyboard to maximize compatibility with things like corporate machines which might prevent fancier integrations. I figured since I wanted a case that would be sort of stable, I might as well throw in a second button and then I realized I had extra switches laying around and thought why not make it more extensible!

The electronics and code aren't too complex, but for me the learning was primarily in designing a case in Fusion 360 and also dabbling with CircuitPython for the first time. The learning curve in Fusion is steep but I picked up many new skills along the way!

## Repo Contents
- CircuitPython Code
- Fritzing diagram
- Models (Fusion, STL)
- Silhouette Labels

## BOM
 - [Trinket M0](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3500) x1
 - Arcade or other momentary switches x2 (I used [these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N5JRU2R/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), but [Adafruit](http://adafruit.com/) has many to choose from and if the Trinket wasn't available on Amazon when I was already placing an order I would have picked up everything from Adafruit!)
 - Toggle switches x2 (I had these lying around from an old water cooler I disassembled)
 - USB cable that supports data transfer (not just power)
 - Screws for mounting the board to the case x2 (these were laying around as well from another random disassembly, the ones I used are about 6-8mm long and about 2mm wide and just fit in the Trinket mounting holes)

- Nothing against Mu, but I wanted to work within Visual Studio Code and ended up using this extension to access serial output. It's got some quirks but by and large worked as expected

- On non-express Adafruit boards, space is quite limited. If you're dev-ing with a Mac, hidden files can exacerbate the problem.

    - This was the big one for me because I was unable to fit all the necessary keyboard libraries on the Trinket otherwise; clearing out all libs and copying files this way did the trick.

## Future Enhancements

- Standoffs too small (one broke off), plus they should really be a tiny bit wider than the through hole ðŸ¤¦
- OS/App selection could be performed with a rotary encoder to eliminate switches and add additional options
- Use proper debounce instead of sleep
- Have the buttons trigger configurable hot keys on the host system that can control the appropriate apps if they are not in the foreground

## Initial Design Notes

Button Dimensions
- 27.1 mm wide
- 23.5 mm for hole diameter
- 27.5 mm deep (inside to contacts)

Board Dimensions
- 27 mm x 15.3 mm x [3.5 mm (usb), 2.75 otherwise]

Micro USB Dimensions
- 6.85 mm x 1.8 mm

Two Buttons
- One for mute/unmute
- One for raise/lower hand

Two switches?
- Mac vs PC
- Zoom vs Teams

Snap fit case
- Component with two nested components for top and bottom
- Length, width, height, shell, and gap (.2 mm and 45 degree for 3D  printing)
